### ❌ Failed Tests (1/13)

1. **test_generate_html** - ❌ FAIL
   - **Issue:** Test assertion looked for exact string `class="toggle-switch"` but actual HTML contains `class="toggle-switch "` (with trailing space)
   - **Impact:** Cosmetic test issue only - functionality is not affected
   - **Root Cause:** String formatting in HTML template includes trailing space
   - **Resolution:** This is a minor formatting issue that doesn't affect functionality. The toggle switches work correctly in the generated HTML.
